# meet

## Purpose:

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## Dependencies:

## User Stories

Feature 2, Scenario 1  
As a user  
I should be able to see a collapsed event element  
So that I can see that there are avialable details without cluttering my view

## Scenarios

FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS

*Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default  
*Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details  
Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details

FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS

*Scenario 1: When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 is the default number  
*Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see

FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE

*Scenario 1: Show cached data when there’s no internet connection  
*Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)

FEATURE 5: DATA VISUALIZATION

Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
